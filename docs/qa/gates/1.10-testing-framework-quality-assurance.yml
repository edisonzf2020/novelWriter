  Story 1.10 represents exceptional work in establishing a comprehensive testing framework 
  for the MCP hybrid architecture. The implementation demonstrates enterprise-grade quality 
  standards with:
  
  - Complete requirements traceability (5/5 ACs covered)
  - Excellent test architecture following industry best practices
  - Comprehensive NFR validation (Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability)
  - Proactive code quality improvements through refactoring
  - CI/CD integration ready for production deployment
  
  The testing framework provides a solid foundation for ensuring quality throughout 
  the architecture refactoring process. Quality score of 96/100 reflects the high 
  standard of implementation that exceeds project expectations.
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Ready for Done - Immediate production deployment approved.
